# Gem Hunters Game

Gem Hunters is a simple console-based 2D game where players compete to collect the most gems within a set number of turns.

## Objective

The objective of the game is to collect as many gems as possible within 30 moves (15 turns for each player). Players can move their character around the board and collect gems while avoiding obstacles.

## Features

- **Board Size**: A 6x6 square board.
- **Players**: 2 player game. Player 1 starts in the top-left corner and Player 2 starts in the bottom-right corner.
- **Gems**: Randomly placed on the board at the start of the game. Gems do not move once placed.
- **Obstacles**: Random positions on the board that players cannot pass through.
- **Turns**: Players alternate turns, with each player getting 15 turns.
- **Winning**: The player with the most gems collected after all turns are exhausted wins. If both players have the same number of gems, it's a tie.
